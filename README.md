<h2>Digital Innovation: Bootcamp GFT - Developing a REST API for person management with Spring Boot</h2>

Nesta live coding vamos desenvolver um pequeno sistema para o gerenciamento de pessoas de uma empresa através de uma API REST, criada com o Spring Boot.

Durante a sessão, serão desenvolvidos e abordados os seguintes tópicos:

* Initial setup using Spring Boot Initialzr
* Creating a data model for mapping entities into databases
* Development of user management operations (Registration, reading, updating and removing people from a system).
* Relation of each of the operations above with the REST architectural pattern, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during project development.
* Development of unit tests for functionality validation

To run the project on the terminal, type the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After executing the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/person
```


The following prerequisites are necessary for the execution of the project developed during the class:

* Java 11.
